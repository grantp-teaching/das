CACHING
=======

(RAID quiz online)

(Topic slightly out of sequence!)

Disks don't always do what you tell them when you tell them.


NATIVE COMMAND QUEUEING
-----------------------

(Forgot to this earlier on, but relevant now)

Disk may re-order received commands to improve performance.

Algorithms:
| Seek-time optimisation
| Access Time Optimisation ( seek time + rotational latency ) 


CACHING Key idea:
----------------
Going to interpose something between the host and disks to speed
things up.  Already seen in cloud architecture: 
| Application-level caches to store results from DB, external APIs.
| Edge caches to store complete web pages from EC2-hosted servers.

Must consider the
INTELLIGENT STORAGE SYSTEM
| May be a "box" or the components may be spread around (hw/sw)

Components:
1) Front-end
2) Cache
3) Back-end
4) Physical disks
